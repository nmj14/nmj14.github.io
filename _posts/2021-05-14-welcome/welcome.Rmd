  Thank you for visiting my website! I am very excited to be finishing up the last of my coursework as a PhD student. This summer I plan on helping to manage a team of biomedical and software engineers to develop a computer program that will display, annotate, and automatically analyze images of disease eyes for clinical research studies.
