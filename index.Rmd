## Bio

I am a PhD candidate studying biomedical engineering at Case Western
Reserve University. My research focuses on developing machine learning and deep 
learning software to analyze ophthalmic images, or images taken of the eye. My 
main project entails predicting future outcomes of cornea transplants. More recently, 
my lab and our collaborators have ventured into the field of Dry Eye Disease to 
design new metrics for defining the disease progression of Meibomian Gland Dysfunction. 

Outside of research I enjoy staying active by running, biking, hiking, weightlifting, 
and I am always up for the challenge of trying to cook a new recipe.
